 		MEEMURE VILLAGE CAMP offers guests an opportunity to experience what it is like to <br> live in the ancient isolated village of Meemure. The village is situated deep in the <br> Knuckles Wilderness, where the local people have maintained their traditional and <br> cultural attitudes towards the forestâ€™s existence. They rely heavily on the forest <br> for their survival and gain as much as 63% of their total income from the forest  <br>resources.
